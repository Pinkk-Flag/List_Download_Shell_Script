# A Shell Script to List your Downloads!

This script lists all files and directories (including hidden files) recursively within your Downloads folder, displaying their full paths.

# Features
* Lists files and directories recursively.
* Works on most Linux and macOS systems.

# Usage

1. Download the repository containing this script.
2. Make the script executable (if necessary):
```
chmod +x list_downloads_all.sh
```
3. Run the script from your terminal after going to that specific directory:
```
./list_downloads_all.sh
```
### What is this for?
Mostly an experimentation on Shell scripting for Linux and MacOS.
